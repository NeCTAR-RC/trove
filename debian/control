Description: Database as a Service for OpenStack - Python 3 lib
 Trove is "Database as a Service" for Openstack. It's designed to allow users
 to quickly and easily utilize the features of a relational database without
 the burden of handling complex administrative tasks.
 .
 Cloud users and database administrators can provision and manage multiple
 database instances as needed. The service focus on providing resource
 isolation at high performance while automating deployment, configuration,
 patching, backups, restores, and monitoring. Trove is designed to support a
 single-tenant database within a Nova instance. There is no restrictions on how
 Nova is configured, since Trove interacts with other OpenStack components
 purely through the API.
 .
 This package provides the Trove Python 3 library.
